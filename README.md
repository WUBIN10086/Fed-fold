_Figure: Comparison of OpenFold and AlphaFold2 predictions to the experimental structure of PDB 7KDX, chain B._

# FedFold重写版文档

A faithful but trainable PyTorch reproduction of DeepMind's 
[AlphaFold 2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold).

# 三条路线：
1. SoloSeq 路线：不依赖 MSA，直接做单序列训练
（[soloseq推理，训练，微调流程复现文档](docs/source/SoloSeq_Reasoning_Train_Finetune_Repro.md)）
2. 标准 OpenFold 路线：自己生成 MSA（DeepMind 方法）
3. 直接用 RODA 数据：最快进入训练状态的大规模路线

# openfold原始文档引导
